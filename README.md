# Traffic Signs Classification using CNN and Flask

This tutorial is about building a traffic sign classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Flask web framework. The system is able to classify traffic signs into different categories such as stop, yield, speed limit, etc. The tutorial is suitable for those who have basic knowledge of Python and Machine Learning.

## Installation

To run this tutorial, you need to install the following packages:

* Python 3.7 or above
* Flask
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* NumPy
* Pillow

You can install these packages using pip package manager by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install flask tensorflow keras numpy pillow
```
